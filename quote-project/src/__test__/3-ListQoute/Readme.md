## List Quotes

We will test ListQuote component.

Define some data, get it from props and test it.

It receives a set of data from the props and displays them as cards on the screen 
And you can copy this data from allQuotesOneAuthor.json and test it

data should be an array of objects with the following properties:

```jsx

const data = [
  {
    id: 15,
    category: "Imagination",
    quote: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.",
    author: "Albert Einstein",
    description:
      "Einstein's perspective on the power of imagination in shaping the future.",
  },
];

```

1. Now check to see that there is a card for each data
